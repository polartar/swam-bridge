# EVM Bridge

The EVM Bridge contains EVM *Portal* smart contracts and centralized middleware for safely transporting Ether and ERC20 tokens to/from EVMs.

Currently, the middleware is in a beta state, however the signing logic and flow is well defined in tests/testBridgeable.js

# Design

Conceptually there are really 2 *Portal* smart contracts of concern:
    * NativePortal - a gateway to an EVM's native token (ie. Ether)
    * ERC20Portal - a gateway to an ERC20 compliant Token.
```    
          +-------------+       +----------------+       +--------------+
          |             +------>+                +------>+              |
          | ERC20Portal |       | Bridge Network |       | NativePortal |
          |             +<------+                +<------+              |
+-------+ +-------------+       +----------------+       +--------------+ +--------+
| 0xBTC |  EVM1 (Mainnet)                               EVM2 (0xBitchain) | "Ether"|
+-------+                                                                 +--------+
```

The System uses these *Portal* contracts, responsible for registering/deregistering validators, and confirming signed transfer requests from users. Validators listen for portal requests from Portal contract entry events and confirm/drop transactions accordingly.

## ERC20 -> Native EVM
An example scenario might be user Alice wishes to transfer 100 0xBitcoin over to the xDAI network in order to pay for services within that environment. The EVM Bridge stack would follow these steps (see test/testERC20ToNative.js):

*Setup step 1: Validators register their address with each Portal contract and initial deployer pairs the addresses of the token contract addresses. This operation can only be performed once during setup to ensure decentralization.
Setup step 2: Side chain native EVM must have enough "Ether" sent to the NativePortal contract address to cover incoming transactions.*

1. The bridge user calls ERC20.approveAndCall() to the ERC20Portal with the 100 0xBitcoin Tokens requested.
2. A regular user calls approveAndCall(), locking 100 0xBTC into the contract and causing the ERCPortal to emit an *EnterBridgeEvent* containing the amount of tokens to transfer across the bridge.
3. The Bridge Network approves and signs the transaction. Once all members have signed the transaction, it is returned to the bridge user. This is performed through a REST call, described below.
4. The bridge user submits the verified transaction to the Native Portal contract on the destination EVM; the *exit()* function.
5. The NativePortal contract sends 100 "Ether" ( not actually Ether, but the native token on the destination EVM ), which is a 1:1 tether to the 0xBitcoin Token on mainnet.
6. In reverse, when the user wants to send the funds back to mainnet, she simply calls the NativePortal first, waits for validation from the bridge network and then calls the ERCPortal which will release the tokens from the contract.

## ERC20 -> ERC20

          | ERC20Portal |       | Bridge Network |       |  ERC20Portal |

| 0xBTC |                                                                | 0xBTC.PEG |
+-------+                                                                +-----------+
```

Transferring value from ERC20 on mainnet to ERC20 on chainnet follows a similar set of steps, except on the chainnet side, ERC20 "Peg" tokens are minted/burned as they enter and exit the EVM.

# Initial EVM setup

1. On Mainnet deploy the target ERC20 token (ie. 0xBitcoin) and the TokenPortal
2. On Chainnet deploy the Bridgeable Token ( ie. 0xBTC.peg ). This token represents the value proxy to the mainnet ERC20 token.
3. On Mainnet, setup validators on the TokenPortal (addValidator)
4. On Mainnet, pair the TokenPortal with the Chainnet Bridgeable Token address (pair)
5. On Chainnet, setup validators on the Bridgeable Token (addValidator)
6. On Chainnet, pair the Bridgeable Token with the Mainnet Token Portal address (pair)

# Performing swap from 'Mainnet' to 'Chainnet'

* Note: Since the state of these transactions is stored 100% between the chains, you can call http://127.0.0.1:4000/transactions/0xYOUR-ADDRESS anytime to get a complete view of the bridge's transactions.

1. Transfer 0xBitcoin to the Token Portal: bitcoin.approveAndCall(TokenPortal.address, tokens, 0x0)
2. Capture the transaction hash from step one and use it to build a 'foreign/verify' curl command to the bridge:
    ```
    curl -d '{ "txnHash": "0x62382efda78ab186b9e30da9b4ac932b6e79cf7c208eeeebf1bfab3522638476" }' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:4000/foreign/verify
    ```
    results:
    ```
    {
    "transactionHash": "0x62382efda78ab186b9e30da9b4ac932b6e79cf7c208eeeebf1bfab3522638476",
    "foreignContract": "0xFA398Cd7037B046fA7Cae20AEEe4FD00E9B35B90",
    "tokens": 20000000000000000000,
    "signatures": "0xdab06f2e4394fcd428e2e491470137c3036835939d0311339a9c3b89ff1f1a5f0539d26d4216fb0cb98fc8951086142c7a0823f80d018f2232dfb857657068e61c"
    }
    ```
    The resulting packet is a deterministic transaction that represents the value of the transfer. It can be used to store tokens completely offchain, as their value is pegged to the token bridge contract on mainnet. This packet will also only work when 'cashed in' by the same user on the side chain.
3. Complete the transfer to the Chainnet by calling the Chain's Token Peg contract's exit() method, using the parameters from the enter() transaction in the previous step
    ```
    tokenpeg.exit(transactionHash, TokenPortal.address, tokens, signatures)
    ```
    Check that your balance is now reflected in the peg contract
    ```
    tokenpeg.balanceOf(0xyour_address)
    ```

# Performing a swap from 'Chainnet' to 'Mainnet'
1. Enter the bridge from the chainnet side: tokenpeg.enter(tokens)
2. Capture the transaction hash from the previous step and use it to build a 'home/verify' curl command to the bridge
    ```
    curl -d '{ "txnHash": "0x008cb7525740933c82819aa5c79bcfb05a479af547138a0a0f9c67a7282e1354" }' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:4000/home/verify
    
    ```
    results:
    ```
    {
        "transactionHash": "0x008cb7525740933c82819aa5c79bcfb05a479af547138a0a0f9c67a7282e1354",
        "foreignContract": "0x6bA494Cc76636bb134BBC3eD4743Fb9b8172c8DF",
        "tokens": 1000000000,
        "signatures": "0xf78bd31638000165943e943ce54b59874d9d53d4f35b3f0f2c4da1207265cc142ff2c84a8f72be983f4e6e3c00a3ebe0113f8953319d9f392c7d51f72197b0bd1b"
    }
    ```
3. Complete the transfer to Mainnet by calling the chain's Portal contract's exit() method, using the parameters from the enter() transaction in the previous step.
    ```
    portal.exit(transactionHash, PegToken.address, tokens, signatures)
    ```
    Check that your balance is now reflected in the target mainnet token contract
    ```
    erc20.balanceOf(0xyour_address)
    ```
